In order to further improve the boiling heat transfer effect, nanostructures with super hydrophilic properties were formed on the surface of sintered copper powder particles by thermal oxidation method, and the boiling heat transfer enhancement effect of porous layer of sintered copper powder with micro nano composite structure was explored
