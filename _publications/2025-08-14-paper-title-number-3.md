Focusing on interpretable, multi-scale semantic segmentation for autonomous driving, DeepLab_KAN extends DeepLabV3+ by replacing standard convolutional layers with Kolmogorovâ€“Arnold Network (KAN) operators and swapping BatchNorm for LayerNorm, thereby improving feature representation and model transparency without significantly increasing computational cost
